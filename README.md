# DSA-Project-Cab_Booking_System
Developed a web-based Cab Booking System that allows users to book rides efficiently while minimizing travel distance. The system calculates the shortest route between pickup and drop locations using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, ensuring optimal ride assignments. Users can view available cabs, book rides, and track their bookings in real-time.
